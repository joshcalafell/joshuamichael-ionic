              My name is Joshua, and I'm a software engineer living Spokane,
              Washington, USA. I'm originally from Colorado, but relocted here
              with my family in 2018 to explore life away from the big city. In
              my spare time, I am involved in Greyhound rescue, I'm a musician,
              I collect cool records, toys, and artifacts, and I am continually
              perfecting the art of making coffee.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a conscientious and resourceful developer focused on making
              accessible software that is thoughtful and engaging. I have a
              can-do attitude, an eye for design, and the ability to assess an
              organizationâ€™s needs to work towards creating complementary and
              robust solutions for web, mobile, and other IoT devices. I also
              have experience creating processes that allow an organization to
              deliver sustainable and reliable products on time and on budget. I
              have been a part of some talented teams over the years and have
              come to understand that to succeed you need positivity, teamwork,
              open mindedness, honest communication, and trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to adhere to DRY and KISS principles, and am always striving
              to create an atmosphere of simplicity even in the most complex
              scenarios. I believe that to create meaningful and lasting
              products, you have to plan so that as complexity increases,
              standards are not sacrificed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Delivering awesome products is what makes me truly happy. That
              being said, the most important things Iâ€™ve learned along my
              journey is that having a positive attitude, being honest and
              humble enough to learn from mistakes, listening to your team, and
              knowing your limits are all essential ingredients to being an
              effective leader and contributor. Lastly, I hold diversity,
              inclusion, and acceptance of all people to be paramount - and
              enjoy working with teams that feel the same.
            </p>
